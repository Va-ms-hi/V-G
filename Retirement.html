<div> <p class="paragraph"> Dhoni announced his retirement from international cricket on 15 August 2020 on the day of India's 74th independence. He did so by posting a video on Instagram that contained pictures from both the best and the worst moments of his career with the song Mai Pal do Pal ka Shayar Hoon playing in the background. The video had been captioned as "Thanks a lot for ur love and support throughout.from 19:29 hrs consider me as Retired".
In November 2020, Dhoni was nominated for the ICC Men's ODI Cricketer of the Decade award. </p><hr> </div>
