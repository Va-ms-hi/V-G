<div><p class="paragraph"> Dhoni is a right-handed batsman and wicket-keeper. Initially, Dhoni appeared as a lower-order attacking batsman but he gradually changed his playing style to deal with high-pressure scenarios and his growing responsibility as a captain. He is a powerful hitter of the ball and is one of the fastest men in running between the wickets. He made use of the helicopter shot technique, taught to him by fellow player and childhood friend Santosh Lal.
His wicket-keeping skill is widely praised by cricket experts.He has a world record for the highest number of stumpings by any wicket-keeper. He is the main wicket-keeper in the team but he occasionally bowls as a medium-fast bowler. </p></div><hr>
